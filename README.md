# Midnight Express
### *Creative works related to the Midnight Express project*
This is a seperate repository related to the project in order to avoid conflicts and issues with the Unreal Engine project. This repository is solely to help with any creative work such as story writing, world building, concept art, etc.

In this repository, there should be different folders to categorize the different areas of creative work:
- Level Design
- World Building
- Story
- Dialogue Scripts
- Zine Guides

Document files should typically be done in __**markdown (.md)**__ files. This is for easy readability on GitHub and simplicity for creating any documentation.
You can check out a markdown guide here for easy guidance.
