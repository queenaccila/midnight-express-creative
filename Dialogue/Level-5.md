# Level 5 Dialogue

### Main Car Entrance :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - MAIN CAR</u>

**Mina:** Back here once again...

[Tux goes ahead to his tiny corner shop, the same one players have visited before.]

**Mina:** Still open for business, huh?

**Mina:** Guess I should see if I need to upgrade anything before I face the Conductor.

**Game Text:** This is your last chance to upgrade before the final challenge. Once you proceed, there's no turning back.

[After the player goes to the door, whether they used the upgrade shop or not]

[Tux waves goodbye.]

**Mina:** Thanks, Tux. I’m glad I had you with me this whole time.

**Mina:** Now, it's time to end this.

### Front Car Entrance :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - FRONT CAR</u>

**Mina:** It's too quiet...

[She slowly walks toward the main console. There’s a strange key slot glowing faintly.]

[Mina pulls out the key she got from the Engineer and inserts it.]

[The laser cannon systems come online.]

**The Conductor:** I should've known he'd give it to you.

[Mina spins around—The Conductor is standing in the shadows]

**Mina:** You’re here...

**The Conductor:** Of course I am. You're holding the key to a place that was only meant for me to access.

**The Conductor:** First I lose the Porter, and now the Engineer has turned against me?

**The Conductor:** I suppose I truly underestimated you.

[The Conductor pulls a level next to him, and a hatch above unlocks and opens]

**The Conductor:** No more games.

**The Conductor:** We are finishing this, on the roof.

### Pre-Boss Scene :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - TOP OF TRAIN</u>

**The Conductor:** I will admit, you managed to get under my nerves in every way.

**The Conductor:** And now you stand there, thinking you’ve earned something. Thinking you deserve this train.

**The Conductor:** I would rather burn it all down than hand it over to you.

**Mina:** You know you don't have to do this.

**Mina:** I didn't come here to take anything from you. We don't need to keep fighting like this.

**The Conductor:** I don't need to be understood. I just need you gone.

**Mina:** If this is the only way you'll listen-

**Mina:** Then come try.

### Post-Boss Scene :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - TOP OF TRAIN</u>

[Mina stands over the defeated Conductor, trying to catch her breath. The room is tense, the laser cannon humming ominously in the background. The Conductor, badly injured but still defiant, struggles to his feet.]

**Mina:** Please, it doesn’t have to end like this.

**Mina:** You don’t have to destroy everything just because you’re afraid to let go.

**The Conductor:** You think I’m afraid? I don’t have a choice.

**The Conductor:** This...this train is my purpose. It’s all I am.

The Conductor: You can’t take that from me!

**Mina:** But you're wrong. You could let go. There’s still time—

**The Conductor:** I refuse. This is mine to control, and I won’t let you take it.

[In a moment of rage and desperation, The Conductor stumbles towards the controls of the laser cannon. He slams a fist down on the panel.]

[The laser cannon hums violently to life, and it begins to charge. The Conductor aims it at Mina, eyes filled with anger and frustration.]

**The Conductor:** You’re not taking anything!

[Suddenly, the cannon begins to malfunction. Sparks fly. The laser shifts erratically, its aim moving off course. The Conductor struggles to regain control.]

**Mina:** Stop! You’re going to destroy everything—

[The laser goes haywire and points directly at The Conductor.]

**Mina:** No!

[The laser suddenly fires, a bright and deadly beam cutting through the room. It strikes The Conductor directly.]

**Mina:** ...

[The laser's hum fades away. The Conductor's hat and coat are all that remains left.]

[Mina looks at the fallen clothes, her chest tight with conflicting emotions. She takes a step forward but stops herself.]

**Mina:** ...What do I do now?

### Game Ending
<u>LOCATION - FRONT CAR</u>

[The scene opens with Mina standing in the control room. The Engineer, the Porter, and Tux stand around her, each looking at her. There's a newfound confidence in her stance.]

**The Engineer:** The Conductor is gone... and now the train is yours.

**The Porter:** What now, Mina? Where do we go from here?

**Tux:** Beep beep!

[Mina takes a deep breath.There's no hesitation in her eyes anymore.]

**Mina:** We're going forward. I won't let our journey end here.

[She steps forward, confidently taking control of the controls. She looks back at the rest of them.]

**Mina:** Let’s see where it takes us.
