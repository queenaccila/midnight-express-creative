**The Porter:** I-I didn't know she was a human! She claimed she is here as a conductor-

[The Conductor lowers his head down towards The Porter. The Porter turns his head away slightly.]

**The Conductor:** Get her out of this train. Now.
**The Porter:** But...shouldn't we stop the train first?

[The Conductor raises his head back and slowly turns away from The Porter.]

**The Conductor:** That only will make the train late for our next stop. Not only is there a human here, but now the train might be running late because of your incompetence.
**The Porter:** I'm sorry! Security is not what I was made for! That's supposed to be *his* job-
**The Conductor:** It does not matter whose job it is. You will get rid of that human and you will clean up this mess.

[The Conductor looks away from The Porter and walks away towards the door. This door connects between the back and middle cars.]

**The Conductor:** I do not care how you do it, but I will not be stopping this train. We're running late enough as it is.

[The Conductor opens the door and leaves the room.]

[The Porter stands there, giving a moment of conflict expression]
