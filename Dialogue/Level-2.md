# Level 2 Dialogue

### Before Level Starts
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

[The Porter enters the back car room in a panic. He shuts the door and gives a brief sigh of relief.]

[The Conductor suddenly appears, scaring The Porter.]

**The Conductor:** Care to explain to me what's going on at the train entrance? Why is there a human girl out there destroying our bots?

**The Porter:** [nervous] Oh, that! Um...I might've...missed her at the door entrance?

**The Conductor:** You just let her in?

[The Conductor steps slowly and menacingly closer to The Porter. The Porter is slowly backing away out of fear.]

**The Porter:** I-I didn't know she was a human! She claimed she's here as the new conductor-

[The Conductor is surprised for a second, and lowers his head down towards The Porter. The Porter turns his head away slightly.]

**The Conductor:** [more sternly] Get her out of this train. Now.
**The Porter:** But...shouldn't we stop the train first? You know, for safety reasons?

[The Conductor raises his head back and slowly turns away from The Porter.]

**The Conductor:** That only will make the train late for our next stop. Not only is there a human here, but now your incompetence is putting us behind schedule.
**The Porter:** I'm sorry! Security is not what I was made for! Besides, isn't that supposed to be *his* job?
**The Conductor:** It does not matter whose job it is. You will get rid of that human and you will clean up this mess.

[The Conductor looks away from The Porter and walks away towards the door. This door connects between the back and middle cars.]

**The Conductor:** I do not care how you do it, but I will not be stopping this train. We're running late enough as it is.

[The Conductor opens the door and leaves the room.]

**The Porter:** [quietly to himself] What have I done?

[He hesitates, looking around the room with uncertainty.]

### Upgrade Shop Preview
<u>LOCATION - MIDDLE CAR ROOM TOWARDS THE BACK</u>

[Mina sees a small lit shop, and walks closer to it out of curiousity]

[Tux is struggling to get out of a wooden crate. Mina sees this and tries to pull the robot out.]

[Tux pops out, shakes his head, and chirps once he sees Mina, showing it as a way of greeting her.]

**Mina:** Oh? A penguin?

### Pre-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

[Mina enters the back of the car, and she sees cargo moving around. The hum of the train and the mechanical conveyor belts were heard.]

[Suddenly, a small drop is heard. The Porter accidentally knocked over a small box, and hid away when he saw Mina spotted her.]

**The Porter:** [nervously] M-Mina...you need to leave.
**Mina:** Look, I don't know what's going on, but I can't just leave without an explanation.
**The Porter:** You don't understand! The Conductor doesn't want you here. He's doing this for a reason! You can't just-
**Mina:** I know The Conductor ordered you to stop me, but I can't give up now.

[The Porter gets more erratic, and gets more anxious by the minute.]

[The Porter starts to get in a more defensive mechanism, getting ready to fight.]

**The Porter:** I'm sorry Mina, but I have to stop you.

**Mina:** Very well then. I'll fight back with what I've got!
