# Level 2 Dialogue

### Before Level Starts
LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM

[The Porter enters the back car room in a panic. He shuts the door and gives a brief sigh of relief.]

[The Conductor suddenly appears, scaring The Porter.]

**The Conductor:** Care to explain to me what's going on at the train entrance? Why is there a human girl out there destroying our bots?

**The Porter:** [nervous] Oh, that! Um...I might've...missed her at the door entrance?

**The Conductor:** You just let her in?

[The Conductor steps slowly and menacingly closer to The Porter. The Porter is slowly backing away out of fear.]

**The Porter:** I-I didn't know she was a human! She claimed she's here as the new conductor-

[The Conductor is surprised for a second, and lowers his head down towards The Porter. The Porter turns his head away slightly.]

**The Conductor:** [more sternly] Get her out of this train. Now.
**The Porter:** But...shouldn't we stop the train first? You know, for safety reasons?

[The Conductor raises his head back and slowly turns away from The Porter.]

**The Conductor:** That only will make the train late for our next stop. Not only is there a human here, but now the train might be running late because of your incompetence.
**The Porter:** I'm sorry! Security is not what I was made for! Besides, isn't that supposed to be *his* job?
**The Conductor:** It does not matter whose job it is. You will get rid of that human and you will clean up this mess.

[The Conductor looks away from The Porter and walks away towards the door. This door connects between the back and middle cars.]

**The Conductor:** I do not care how you do it, but I will not be stopping this train. We're running late enough as it is.

[The Conductor opens the door and leaves the room.]

[The Porter stands there, giving a moment of conflict expression]

**Mina:** Oh? A penguin?
