# Level 2 Dialogue

>**NOTE:** ??? = The Conductor

### Before Level Starts :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

[The Porter enters the back car room in a panic. He shuts the door and gives a brief sigh of relief.]

[??? suddenly appears as a dark mysterious figure, scaring The Porter as he turns around.]

**???:** Care to explain to me what's going on?

**???:** And why is there a human girl out there destroying our bots? Breaching our security?

**The Porter:** [nervous] Oh, that! 

**The Porter:** Um...I might've...missed her at the door entrance?

**???:** You just let her in?

**The Porter:** I-I didn't know she was a human! She claimed she's here as the new conductor-

**???:** [more sternly] Get her out of this train. Now.

**The Porter:** But...shouldn't we stop the train first? You know, for safety reasons?

**???:** That only will make the train late for our next stop.

**???:** Not only is there a human here, but now your incompetence is putting us behind schedule.

**The Porter:** I'm sorry! Security is not what I was built for!

**The Porter:** Besides, isn't that supposed to be *his* job?

**???:** It does not matter whose job it is. You will get rid of that human and you will clean up this mess. We're running late enough as it is.

[??? looks away from The Porter and walks away towards the door. This door connects between the back and middle cars.]

**???:** And if you don't get rid of her, I will make sure your replacement is ready at our next stop.

[??? opens the door and leaves the room.]

**The Porter:** [quietly to himself] What have I done?

### Upgrade Shop Preview :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - MIDDLE CAR ROOM TOWARDS THE BACK</u>

[Mina sees a small lit shop, and walks closer to it out of curiousity]

[Tux is struggling to get out of a wooden crate. Mina sees this and tries to pull the robot out.]

[Tux pops out, shakes his head, and chirps once he sees Mina, showing it as a way of greeting her.]

**Mina:** Oh? A penguin?

[Tux communicates to Mina by waving at her]

**Mina:** Does it want something from me?

**Mina:** What's your name, little guy?

[Tux spells out his name on a gadget board above his head]

**Mina:** Tux?

**Mina:** What a cute little name!

[Tux points at the item Mina has (aka orbs she got from enemies)]

**Mina:** Oh, you want this?

**Mina:** (I might as well give it. I have no idea what this is for...)

[Mina gives Tux the item, and Tux creates a brand new health pack and gives it to her.]

**Mina:** Wow! You made this for me! Thank you!

[Upgrade shop UI pops up on screen]

**Game Text:** When Mina collects orbs from defeating enemies, Tux can use these to upgrade Mina's abilities.

**Game Text:** Upgrade your health and attack power so Mina can last longer in battle and defeat stronger enemies with ease!

[Upgrade shop UI closes]

**Game Text:** Find Tux at his shop, and he will upgrade your abilities!

### Pre-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

[Mina enters the back of the car, and she sees cargo moving around. The hum of the train and the mechanical conveyor belts were heard.]

[Suddenly, a small drop is heard. The Porter accidentally knocked over a small box, and hid away when he saw Mina spotted her.]

**The Porter:** [nervously] M-Mina...you need to leave.

**Mina:** Look, I don't know what's going on, but I can't just leave without an explanation.

**The Porter:** You don't understand! The Conductor doesn't want you here. He's doing this for a reason! You can't just-

**Mina:** I know The Conductor ordered you to stop me, but I can't give up now.

[The Porter gets more erratic, and gets more anxious by the minute.]

[The Porter starts to get in a more defensive mechanism, getting ready to fight.]

**The Porter:** I'm sorry Mina, but I have to stop you.

**Mina:** Very well then. I'll fight back with what I've got!
