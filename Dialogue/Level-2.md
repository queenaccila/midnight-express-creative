# Level 2 Dialogue

>**NOTE:** ??? = The Conductor

### Before Level Starts :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

[The Porter enters the back car room in a panic. He shuts the door and gives a brief sigh of relief.]

[??? suddenly appears as a dark mysterious figure, scaring The Porter as he turns around.]

**???:** Care to explain to me what's going on?

**???:** And why is there a human girl out there destroying our bots? Breaching our security?

**The Porter:** [nervous] Oh, that! 

**The Porter:** Um...I might've...missed her at the door entrance?

**???:** You just let her in?

**The Porter:** I-I didn't know she was a human! She claimed she's here as the new conductor-

**???:** [more sternly] Get her out of this train. Now.

**The Porter:** But...shouldn't we stop the train first? You know, for safety reasons?

**???:** That only will make the train late for our next stop.

**???:** Not only is there a human here, but now your incompetence is putting us behind schedule.

**The Porter:** I'm sorry! Security is not what I was built for!

**The Porter:** Besides, isn't that supposed to be *his* job?

**???:** It does not matter whose job it is. You will get rid of that human and you will clean up this mess. We're running late enough as it is.

[??? looks away from The Porter and walks away towards the door. This door connects between the back and middle cars.]

**???:** And if you don't get rid of her, I will make sure your replacement is ready at our next stop.

[??? opens the door and leaves the room.]

**The Porter:** [quietly to himself] What have I done?

### Upgrade Shop Preview :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - MIDDLE CAR ROOM TOWARDS THE BACK</u>

[Mina sees a small lit shop, and walks closer to it out of curiousity]

[Tux is struggling to get out of a wooden crate. Mina sees this and tries to pull the robot out.]

[Tux pops out, shakes his head, and chirps once he sees Mina, showing it as a way of greeting her.]

**Mina:** Oh? A penguin?

[Tux communicates to Mina by waving at her]

**Mina:** Does it want something from me?

**Mina:** What's your name, little guy?

[Tux spells out his name on a gadget board above his head]

**Mina:** Tux?

**Mina:** What a cute little name!

[Tux points at the item Mina has (aka orbs she got from enemies)]

**Mina:** Oh, you want this?

**Mina:** (I might as well give it. I have no idea what this is for...)

[Mina gives Tux the item, and Tux creates a brand new health pack and gives it to her.]

**Mina:** Wow! You made this for me! Thank you!

[Upgrade shop UI pops up on screen]

**Game Text:** When Mina collects orbs from defeating enemies, Tux can use these to upgrade Mina's abilities.

**Game Text:** Upgrade your health and attack power so Mina can last longer in battle and defeat stronger enemies with ease!

[Upgrade shop UI closes]

**Game Text:** Find Tux at his shop, and he will upgrade your abilities!

### Pre-Boss Scene 
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

**Mina:** No more running. I need answers.

**The Porter:** A-ah!!

**The Porter:** Listen, I-I don't want to hurt you!

**Mina:** I don't either. But I need you to give me some answers.

**Mina:** At least tell me what's going on. Why am I not wanted here when there was a planned ticket for me?

**The Porter:** I-I don't know! I just follow protocols!

**The Porter:** All he told me was to get you off of the train. By any means necessary.

**Mina:** Who is "he"? The current conductor?

[The camera rotates to face Mina and blinks red, and The Porter is worried.]

**The Porter:** If you don't listen to me, both of us are going to be gone by him!

**Mina:** Shouldn't he at least stop the train? So I can get off the train safely?

**The Porter:** The Conductor doesn't want to make any more delays unfortunately.

**The Porter:** 

**Mina:** (Some conductor this guy is...)

[The equipment powers on, with the cargo ready to swing or fall onto Mina.]

**The Porter:** Please forgive me...I have no choice.

### Post-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - BACK CAR ROOM</u>

[The battle ends. The Porter sparks and whirs before collasping into a luggage.]

[The luggage rattles, and pops out The Porter in a smaller key-like form, showing his weakened state.]

[Mina cautiously approaches]

**Mina:** Are you...okay?

**The Porter:** Systems… critical. No longer fit for service. Preparing for shipment to recycling hub.

**Mina:** Recycling?! But you didn't need to-

**The Porter:** It's protocol. I failed. The train - especially *him* - doesn't tolerate errors.

[The cameras all lock onto Mina. The speaker goes off.]

**???:** What a shame. The Porter has always been one of the most efficient units on the Midnight Express.

**???:** I now have to reorganize the entire cargo system myself, thanks to you.

**Mina:** Huh?? Who are you?

**???:**  Who I am should not matter to those who show up uninvited, disrupt operations, and threaten my position.

**Mina:** Your position? Then you must be-

**???:** You may hold a ticket, but it was not authorized by me. 

[The cameras turn off, leaving Mina alone in the room with the weakened Porter.]

**Mina:** He didn’t know I was coming… No one told him?

**Mina:** No wonder why everything’s been hostile. Even with my ticket, I’m still seen as a threat.

[The Porter flashes a small blinker light, trying to get Mina's attention.]

**The Porter:** Mina...

[Mina turns around and kneels beside The Porter.]

**The Porter:** Let me help you while I still can.

**Mina:** You're not worried about getting in more trouble?

**The Porter:** I'm already boxed and ready for disposal. As far as he’s concerned, I’ve been... removed from service.

**The Porter:** Whether you're here as the new conductor or not, the Midnight Express was designed to welcome its passengers—not attack them.

**The Porter:** I don’t know why everything's changed... but someone should be on your side.

**Mina:** Thank you. I'm going to figure this out.

**Mina:** And I'll make sure you're not just thrown away.
