# Level 4 Dialogue

### Beginning Scene
<u>LOCATION - UNDERCAR (dimly lit, mechanical ambience)</u>

[Mina opens her eyes. She slowly she sits up and is still recovering.]

**Mina:** Where… am I?

[She looks around. The place is colder, darker, and there's distant gear movement in the background]

**Mina:** Does it even matter?

**Mina:** I couldn’t stop him. I’m not...meant for this.

[She stares at the floor, gripping her arm where she was struck.]

**Mina:** I really thought...maybe I had a place here.

[A soft mechanical beep breaks the silence. Mina glances up. Tux waddles into view, blinking and beeping with urgency.]

**Mina:** Tux?

**Mina:** What are you doing down here?

[Tux beeps again—more insistent this time—and begins walking ahead a few steps before turning back.]

**Mina:** You want me to come with you?

[Tux nods with a soft chirp. His eye lights blink like a guiding light.]

**Mina:** You’re not giving up on me, huh?

[Mina looks down at her sword lying beside her. She hesitates, then grips it tightly and stands.]

Mina: Alright, one step at a time.

[She starts following Tux deeper into the undercar.]

### Pre-Boss Scene
[mina runs up to tux]
[the engineer shots towards mina, barely missing her]
[mina looks up to see the engineer]
[the engineer is pissed off at mina, as she's been causing a ruckus from above and thought she was going to hurt tux next]
[mina finds out tux is one of the engineer's creations]
[she tries to tell the engineer he was helping her, but the engineer refused to listen]
[tux "talks" to the engineer, convincing him to not hurt mina]
[the engineer listens to tux, and reconsiders wanting to just get rid of her]
[the engineer will give her one chance, to test and see if she's good enough as the new conductor]
[mina has doubt, but tux beeps again, telling her (through the engineer translating) that she was amazing fighting like that up above]
[the engineer hears all of this, and tries to convince her to fight him, especially since it's been a long time since he's fought a human]

### Boss Lines (in combat)
