# Level 4 Dialogue

### Beginning Scene :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - UNDERCAR (dimly lit, mechanical ambience)</u>

[Mina opens her eyes. She slowly she sits up and is still recovering.]

**Mina:** Where… am I?

[She looks around. The place is colder, darker, and there's distant gear movement in the background]

**Mina:** Does it even matter?

**Mina:** I couldn’t stop him. I’m not...meant for this.

[She stares at the floor, gripping her arm where she was struck.]

**Mina:** I really thought...maybe I had a place here.

[A soft mechanical beep breaks the silence. Mina glances up. Tux waddles into view, blinking and beeping with urgency.]

**Mina:** Tux?

**Mina:** What are you doing down here?

[Tux beeps again—more insistent this time—and begins walking ahead a few steps before turning back.]

**Mina:** You want me to come with you?

[Tux nods with a soft chirp. His eye lights blink like a guiding light.]

**Mina:** You’re not giving up on me, huh?

[Mina looks down at her sword lying beside her. She hesitates, then grips it tightly and stands.]

**Mina:** Alright, one step at a time.

[She starts following Tux deeper into the undercar.]

### Pre-Boss Scene :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - ENGINE ROOM (giant stage-like area with mechanical towers and spotlights)</u>

[Mina rushes through the undercar, her sword in hand. She spots Tux ahead.]

**Mina:** Tux!

[Just as she reaches him, a sudden clang—a bolt of energy slams the ground next to her. She stumbles back, eyes snapping upward.]

[A towering figure steps from the shadows above—The Engineer, eyes glowing, expression furious.]

**The Engineer:** Stay away from him.

[Mina freezes, still shielding Tux instinctively.]

**The Engineer:** You've made a quite the mess of my systems. And now you're after my own creation?!

**Mina:** No! He chose to help me! I didn’t hurt him—

**Mina:** Wait, did you say your creation?

**Tux:** Beep-beep-beep!

[Tux steps in front of Mina, blinking up at the Engineer, chirping rapidly.]

[The Engineer stares silently at him. A long pause.]

**The Engineer:** ...You’re defending her?

**Tux:** Beep-beep.

[A small nod from Tux.]

**The Engineer:** ...Hmph.

**The Engineer:** You’re lucky he cares.

**The Engineer:** But luck doesn’t get you far on this train.

[He turns back to her, sharp and focused.]

**The Engineer:** So here’s what we’ll do.

[Sparks shoot up the sides of the room. The stage hums to life.]

**The Engineer:** One test. Right here. Right now.

**The Engineer:** Let’s see if you’re conductor material like what Tux claims you to be.

[Mina falters slightly.]

**Mina:** But...

**Mina:** I’m not even sure what I am anymore...

**Tux:** Beep!

[He beeps encouragingly, jumping a little.]

[The Engineer glances at him, then sighs.]

**The Engineer:** He says you fought well up there. More than he’s seen in a long time.

**Mina:** You said you 

**Mina:** So...who even are you?

**The Engineer:** I am The Engineer. I am the one who actually runs the systems. (not The Conductor)

**The Engineer:** That is why I need to see your skills myself.

[He powers up his arm.]

**The Engineer:** Fight me, Mina.

**The Engineer:** Let’s see if you can take the heat down here.

### Boss Lines (in combat) :white_check_mark:

<u>When Mina charges in and not defending</u>

The Engineer: Keep charging in, and I'll keep knocking you down!

The Engineer: Always rushing in. No wonder he overpowered you.

The Engineer: I've seen machines with better timing!

<u>When Mina successfully parries attacks for the first time</u>

The Engineer: Heh. Didn't think you'd catch on so fast.

### Post-Boss Scene
[the engineer has respect for mina]
[the engineer is trying to ]
