### Ticket Machine

[Mina puts a ticket in the machine. A small jingle starts and an automated voice speaks from the machine.]

[The automated machine is in The Conductor's voice]

**Automated Machine:** Ticket verified. Welcome aboard! Please enjoy your journey on the Midnight Express. Your adventure awaits!

### Entering The Train

[Mina enters the main train room. She takes in the view of the vast interior of the train compared to how it looked on the outside.]

[The Porter enters the room, occupied with surrounding robots and delivering packages. He initially sees Mina and ignores her, but takes a second look to realize he doesn't recognize her.]

**The Porter:** Who are you?! What are you doing here?!
**Mina:** I'm Mina. I'm supposed to be the new conductor-
**The Porter:** 

**Mina:** I was sent a ticket to board. I'm here to help run the train.

[The Porter backs away, growing anxious and looking around, as if eyes are watching him.]

**The Porter:** No-no-no, that can't be! The Conductor has always been in charge! You shouldn't be here!

**Mina:** Wait!

[The Porter runs off and shuts the door to the back car.]

[The back car door reopens after Mina uses the key that got dropped by one of the enemies.]
