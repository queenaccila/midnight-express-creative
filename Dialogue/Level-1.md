### Entering The Train :white_check_mark:

[Mina enters the main train room. She takes in the view of the vast interior of the train compared to how it looked on the outside.]

**The Porter:** Who are you?! What are you doing here?!

**Mina:** Oh! You scared me!

**Mina:** My name is Mina. I'm supposed to be the new conductor-

**The Porter:** New conductor? That can't be right...

**Mina:** I was sent a ticket to board. Look, this ticket here is what got the train to make a stop here.
