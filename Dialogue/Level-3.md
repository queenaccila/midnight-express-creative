### Introduction To The Chaperones
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATRE (aka stage 2)</u>

**The Conductor:** You stepped onto my train, and it told me everything I needed to know.

**The Conductor:** What makes you worthy of being the next conductor?

[The Chaperones turn aggressive, and they face Mina, ready to fight her]

### Pre-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATURE cont.</u>

[Mina moves quickly when The Conductor's sword gets thrown onto the stage, which startles Mina.]

**The Conductor:** That's enough!

[The Conductor jumps down from the balcony seamlessly. He slowly pulls out his sword that was thrown onto the stage.]

**The Conductor:** It seems that I must take care of things myself.

[The Conductor swings sword before the fight begins. He points his sword at Mina.]

**The Conductor:** Let me show you why I run this train.

### Post-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATURE cont.</u>

[Mina is struck down, and she tries to steady herself with her sword.]

**The Conductor:** It seems you are not quite worthy. I expected as much.

[Mina tries to get up again too quickly and charges again at The Condcutor in an attempt to prove him wrong.]

**Mina:** I'm not done yet!

[Their swords clash, with Mina struggling to push her sword against The Conductor's sword.]

**The Conductor:** Look at you, struggling to fight. Do you really believe you are capable of being the next conductor, when you can't even win against me?

[There's a flash of Mina's face showing doubt, and the Conductor uses it as an opening to push Mina away towards the edge of the pit. Mina is on her knees and is barely able to stand using her sword to prop her up.]

**The Conductor:** Goodbye, Mina.

[The Conductor gives one final push using the end of his sword sheathe towards Mina, pushing her into the pit and losing her balance by falling into the pit below.]

**Mina:** aaaAHHHH!!!

[The Conductor looks into the pit, and sees Mina falling.]

[He walks away, thinking Mina wouldn't make that fall.]
