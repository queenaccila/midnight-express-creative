### Introduction To The Chaperones :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATRE (aka stage 2)</u>

**The Conductor:** Welcome, to the Main Car of the Midnight Express.

**The Conductor:** It has been so long since we recieved a guest.

[??? steps into the spotlight, revealing himself as The Conductor]

**The Conductor:** Though, I believe you are not one.

**Mina:** (So it *is* the conductor...)

**Mina:** I thought I was invited to help out. As the new conductor.

**The Conductor:** "Invited", she says... How quaint. 

**The Conductor:** You’ve caused quite the disruption for someone who was “invited.” One broken Porter. Cargo routines scrambled. Unlocked cars without clearance...

**The Conductor:** You’ve thrown my train into chaos.

**The Conductor:** So I ask you, Mina...

**The Conductor:** What made you join as a conductor?

[The Chaperones slowly lower and surround Mina]

**Mina:** I-

**Mina:** ...

**The Conductor:** What's this? No answer?

**The Conductor:** I expected as much.

**The Conductor:** I will give you one chance to prove yourself. Since it seems you are not fully comprehending this weight of this role.

[The Chaperones hover down and surround Mina, ready to attack]

**The Conductor:** Test her conviction.

**The Conductor:** Impressive. You didn't crumble.

**The Conductor:** But it is not enough.

[The Conductor jumps down from the balcony seamlessly. He slowly pulls out his sword that was not seen before.]

**The Conductor:** It seems that I must take care of things myself.

[The Conductor swings sword before the fight begins. He points his sword at Mina.]

**The Conductor:** Let me show you why I run this train.

### Post-Boss Scene :white_check_mark:
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATURE cont.</u>

[Mina is struck down, and she tries to steady herself with her sword.]

**The Conductor:** It seems you are not quite worthy. I expected as much.

**Mina:** I'm not finished...

[Mina tries to charge at The Conductor, but he simply pushes her away.]

**The Conductor:** Look at you, struggling to fight.

**The Conductor:** Do you really believe you are capable of being the next conductor, when you can't even win against me?

**Mina:** ...

**The Conductor:** No last words? Then let this be your last stop.

[The Conductor uses his sword and taps into the stage floor. A trapdoor opens beneath Mina, causing her to fall beneath the stage.]

[The Conductor looks into the pit, and sees Mina falling.]

**The Conductor:** Goodbye, Mina.

[He walks away, thinking Mina wouldn't make that fall as the stage trapdoors close.]
