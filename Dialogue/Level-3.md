### Introduction To The Chaperones
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATRE (aka stage 2)</u>

**The Conductor:** Welcome, to the Main Car of the Midnight Express.

**The Conductor:** It has been so long since we recieved a guest.

[??? steps into the spotlight, revealing himself as The Conductor]

**The Conductor:** Though, I do not believe you are one.

**Mina:** (So it *is* the conductor...)

**Mina:** I thought I was invited to help out as the new conductor.

**The Conductor:** "Invited", she says...

**The Conductor:** You’ve caused quite the disruption for someone who was “invited.” One broken Porter. Cargo routines scrambled. Unlocked cars without clearance...

**The Conductor:** You’ve thrown my train into chaos, and we're only now just meeting each other.

**The Conductor:** So I ask you, Mina...

**The Conductor:** Why were you even invited to the Midnight Express in the first place?

[The Chaperones slowly lower and surround Mina]

**Mina:** I-

**Mina:** I don't even know...

**The Conductor:** At last — honesty.

**The Conductor:** Everything is in disarray because of you. But yet here you stand, as if you are entitled to this train.

**The Conductor:** How could you even dare to lead this train?

**Mina:** ...

**Mina:** I may not know why I was invited-

**Mina:** But I'm not going to let this train to the ground.

**The Conductor:** Let's see then if your actions can make up for your lack of conviction.

### Pre-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATURE cont.</u>

[The Conductor jumps down from the balcony seamlessly. He slowly pulls out his sword that was not seen before.]

**The Conductor:** It seems that I must take care of things myself.

[The Conductor swings sword before the fight begins. He points his sword at Mina.]

**The Conductor:** Let me show you why I run this train.

### Post-Boss Scene
<u>LOCATION - AMPHITHEATURE cont.</u>

[Mina is struck down, and she tries to steady herself with her sword.]

**The Conductor:** It seems you are not quite worthy. I expected as much.

[Mina tries to get up again too quickly and charges again at The Condcutor in an attempt to prove him wrong.]

**Mina:** I'm not done yet!

[Their swords clash, with Mina struggling to push her sword against The Conductor's sword.]

**The Conductor:** Look at you, struggling to fight. Do you really believe you are capable of being the next conductor, when you can't even win against me?

[There's a flash of Mina's face showing doubt, and the Conductor uses it as an opening to push Mina away towards the edge of the pit. Mina is on her knees and is barely able to stand using her sword to prop her up.]

**The Conductor:** Goodbye, Mina.

[The Conductor gives one final push using the end of his sword sheathe towards Mina, pushing her into the pit and losing her balance by falling into the pit below.]

**Mina:** aaaAHHHH!!!

[The Conductor looks into the pit, and sees Mina falling.]

[He walks away, thinking Mina wouldn't make that fall.]
