### Other Notes
- **Main theme:** *Fear of Change vs. Embracing the Future*
- The Conductor is the one who sent Mina to come here so he can prove that he's the only conductor the Midnight Express needs.
- The Porter becomes more accepting of Mina after they fight, and Mina has to "recalibrate" him so he can see Mina isn't a threat to the train
- The Porter himself is more timid compared to The Conductor and The Engineer. He was scared of the consequences of helping an outsider, but he got the courage to help Mina because he can't ignore her potential
- The Conductor slowly feels more and more threatened by Mina when some of the robots in the train are being more friendly towards her and refusing to listen to him
- The Conductor does a basic fight against Mina 
- The Engineer sees potential in Mina, and this was the tipping point for The Conductor before he wanted to fully get rid of Mina, especially seeing she's still alive after he thought he finished her off earlier
- Tux is made to be curious, which is one of the  of the Midnight Express
- “You were never here to take the train from him,” he says. “You were here to lead it forward.” - The Engineer
- The Conductor creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, where he realizes he is replaceable and tries to take multiple measures to prevent this from ever happening. Doing this, however, only stregthends the idea that Mina will replace him.
    - The main thing that solidifies it is when The Conductor is trying so hard to keep the train running to a specific destination. But the closer the destination the train reaches, the more Mina is becoming worthy as a conductor.
- The Engineer tells Mina that countless other humans that were given tickets were given the test of being the new conductor, but none of them ever passed. The Conductor feels more threatened by Mina because she's a lot stronger than he anticipated.
    - Mina is unsure if she's strong enough to fight the Conductor, given how she lost to him and his tricks.
- The Conductor gets hit and pushed by a giant laser beam in the end?
- The Engineer's fight is made to help push Mina's limits rather than kill her. It's made to help her understand what it truly means to be the conductor of the Midnight Express.
    - In the actual game the player learns how to parry (a new move) and how to properly dodge (a previous unlocked move)
    - Being the conductor isn't about being the strongest, but rather knowing when to fight, when to guide, and when to stand her ground
- Mina is someone who wants to protect and help, but she looks at things one-dimensionally and not looking at other ways of how something can work or be resolved. AKA she doesn't broaden her perspective or is open-minded.
    - This is a mirror of the Conductor as he only views things one way.
    - Mina uses everything she's learned (both attack and defense) to overcome the Conductor's fight, which shows she's changed while the Conductor is still stuck in his ways.
- Boss fight game designs:
    - The Porter - Test the basics of the combat system, more focus on attacks than defense
    - The Conductor (level 3) - Test the combat system further, mainly through more air attacks or harder moves to implement
    - The Engiener - Test the defense moves (dodging and parrying) and how to time attacks properly
    - The Conductor (level 5) - Test everything the player has learned from the past several levels
- The Conductor is particularly pissed off of Mina delaying everything, as they're doing a shipment of avocadoes and other various exotic fresh produce to the capital, so they are on both a time limit and making sure the produce stays in good quality within that time limit.
- The Porter boss fight involves a packaging machine, and Mina has to push him in it as part of the actual boss fight
