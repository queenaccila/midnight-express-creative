# Basic Story Outline
*This is a story outline to guide how each level is laid out*

### Game Beginning
- Mina has a "special ticket" for the Midnight Express, which is what caused the train to stop where Mina was
- She got the ticket from a 

### Level 1

### Level 2

**Pre-Boss Scene**
- The Porter sees Mina has a ticket, but gets confused since she's not on the registry
- 

**Post-Boss Scene**
- Mina gets access to the ticket logs, where she finds out her ticket had been manually issued, unsure of who did it
- It jumps to a new scene, where The Conductor can see Mina through faint traces of the Midnight Express insignia throughout the train.
- His star eyes glow in the darker room of the front train car interior

### Level 3
**Before Level**
- There's a simple train jingle that's heard as Mina re-enters main train car
- This is followed by an announcement by the Conductor on the overcom, saying a guest has been tampering with the train's system
- The Chaperones (aka swans) start to become hostile, which introduces them as a new enemy type

- "It seems our esteemed guest has overstayed her welcome." - The Conductor says as he enters the amphitheatre

**Pre-Boss Scene**
- The Conductor takes Mina's ticket after one of the Chaperones took it from her.

**Post-Boss Scene**
- The Conductor thought Mina was foolish and naive to think she has protection as a human passenger as long as she had that ticket
- The Conductor rips the ticket into pieces, and Mina is shocked he has capabilities to think of doing that (as a robot with only one purpose)
- Mina falls into a giant pit with the ticket pieces falling with her down below

### Level 4
**Before Level**
- To transition into this level, Mina is passed out and injured
- Mina sees a blurry figure looming over Tux, and a faint voice asking Tux about who this girl is
- The faint voice tells Tux to get rid of her despite Tux begging him to keep her alive
- The Engineer warns Tux to get rid of her, or he's going to do it himself
- She passes out and sees faint red eyes glowing (hinting it's The Engineer)

**Throughout Level**
- Mina follows Tux through the underground system, wondering where he was going and if he was trying to hide her from something
- She notices the insignias are purposely covered up (The Engineer doesn't want The Conductor's eyes in his personal space)

**Pre-Boss Scene**
- Mina is following Tux as they're navigating through the large under-train system
- She couldn't help but notice them passing by a giant room that looked like the main underground workings of the train, and it made her want to go inside, which was away from Tux
- Tux didn't notice her getting left behind right away, and only noticed when he turned around, expecting her to be near her
- When Tux sees Mina walking into the giant steam room, he panicked, and rushed after her
- Mina enters the giant steam room, curious of what she was seeing, and Tux tried to stop her and push her to leave.
- Mina and Tux are about to leave the room, but the giant door shuts them in
- The Engineer appears, getting furious at Tux for not getting rid of her like he told him to.
- The Engineer separates Tux from Mina, trapping him in a clear cage so he doesn't interfere
- This is where The Engineer plans to get rid of Mina himself (and the boss fight is initiated)

### Level 5
