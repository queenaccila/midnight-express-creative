### Level 3
- Mina has doubt that she's capable of being the next conductor
    - The Conductor makes her think the mess going on in the train is all her fault
    - This is cemented in her when she loses against The Conductor
- The Conductor uses his sword to tap into the stage, a glowing outline surrounds Mina and opens a trap door to make her fall through
- The trap door goes into the Engineer's underground level

### Level 4
- Mina wakes up to find herself in the Engineer's undercar level
- Tux guides her to the main stage that The Engineer is in
- The Engineer is much more cynical and has a hint of anger in his tone, mainly due to him and The Conductor have a power struggle of running the train
- The Engineer's dialogue makes Mina reveal why she actually got invited to the train
- She was a nobody, and didn't have a name. She used to have family a long time ago, but they were gone for so long that they felt like distant memories for her
- Mina learns how to properly dodge and parry than just run in and fight
- The Engineer gives Mina an item to access a specific door to the front car, and Tux has to lead her there since he knows the location of the entrance
    - This is done after the main fight

### Level 5
- Mina fights The Conductor on top of the train
- The Conductor has gone full rogue and only wants to get rid of Mina now
- The Conductor makes snide comments on The Engineer, seeing the item Mina carries.
    - He gets pissed seeing the item that belonged to The Engineer and he knows it does, as it was an item 
    - The Conductor hints that he used to trust The Engineer, but has bad blood with him now. That item was an old symbol of trust since it opens up the door to The Conductor's private front car.
