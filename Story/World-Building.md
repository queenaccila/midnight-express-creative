# World Building
*Here is an overall document of everything relating to the world building around Midnight Express*

### Purpose of the Midnight Express
- It was a luxury train but can be accessible for anyone
- Each passenger had access to this train using exclusive "golden tickets"

### Golden Tickets
- The Porter is responsible for crafting the tickets, and has a hand in choosing who boards the train
- [add logic as to how The Porter can get specific passenger's identification encoded on the ticket before they even board the train]
- Every golden ticket is listed on a registry that The Porter keeps, and they keep track of which ones get used by who
- Tickets are a one-time use. This is because the train only goes one-way on most trips due to the power it takes for one trip

### Train Security
- All of the security was built by The Engineer
- Tux is a helper that the Engineer created so he himself didn't have to leave the train underground
- Tux is The Engineer's eyes and ears, but Tux himself is programmed to be more friendly so it's easier for him to approach the passengers
- He has a failsafe system that acts an emergency conductor in case both him or The Conductor are unable to drive the train

### Rise/Decline of the Midnight Express
- Because the Midnight Express went beyond expectations, The Conductor and many of the robots on board are working more often than they were intended to handle.
- The Conductor's memory is often overclocking and being used frequently because of constant checking on different areas of the train. This is what causes his memory to suffer the most compared to the Engineer or the Porter
- The Engineer can feel a bit of his memory degrading as well, and he sometimes forgets about Tux
- ***There's still one unused and unwritten golden ticket on the ticket registry, and The Conductor will keep the train going until that last ticket has been used***

### Train Cleanliness
- Although the train hasn't had a human passenger in years, the train still keeps moving as if there were still passengers
- This is why the train still looks clean and uptight despite not having passengers for years
- Especially with the Conductor being meticulous and perfectionist with the train, the robots still do their duty (which includes keeping the train clean)

### Mina's Ticket
- She has a train ticket that goes to a very specific location, but she isn't sure why 
- 

### The Conductor's Hostility
- The Conductor's memory has slowly been degrading over time, but there isn't any way he can get any help (at least that he is aware of)
- With the lack of human passengers and his memory degradation, he starts seeing humans as foreign entities that entered the train and tries to get rid of them
- This is why Mina is targeted even with her having a ticket on the train

### The Engineer's Help
- The Engineer initially is hostile towards Mina due to her being in trouble with the Conductor and Tux has been helping her.
- He gets angry when Tux has been helping Mina, as the Conductor can easily get rid of Tux if he sees that Tux was going against orders
- He used to willingly follow the Conductor's orders, as they were always logical and the Conductor was always efficient with running things on the Midnight Express
- He can see the Conductor is not what he used to be, and even feels the effects of degradation himself. He's had the chance to look at the Conductor's physical memory, and it was in a worse state than he thought.
