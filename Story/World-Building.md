# World Building
*Here is an overall document of everything relating to the world building around Midnight Express*

### Purpose of the Midnight Express
- It was a luxury train designed for the world's most powerful and influential figures (CEOs, royalty, celebrities)
- This train was made to be a safe haven for high figures so they can travel undetected from outside threats
- Each passenger had access to this train using exclusive "golden tickets"

### Golden Tickets
- The Porter is responsible for crafting the tickets, and has a hand in choosing who boards the train
- [add logic as to how The Porter can get specific passenger's identification encoded on the ticket before they even board the train]
- Every golden ticket is listed on a registry that The Porter keeps, and they keep track of which ones get used by who
- Tickets are a one-time use. This is because the train only goes one-way on most trips due to the power it takes for one trip

### Train Security
- All of the security was built by The Engineer
- Tux is a helper that the Engineer created so he himself didn't have to leave the train underground
- Tux is The Engineer's eyes and ears, but Tux himself is programmed to be more friendly so it's easier for him to approach the passengers
- He has a failsafe system that acts an emergency conductor in case both him or The Conductor are unable to drive the train

### Decline of the Midnight Express
- This all started when The Conductor lost it and killed a human passenger
- The human passenger was a CEO of a flight company, and saw the train as a threat to his business
- The CEO tried to sabotoge The Conductor, hoping it'll ruin the train's business, but it resulted in him getting killed
- Although this CEO was gone, 
- Because all of the passengers were influential and powerful figures, they all had power to shut down the train after that incident occurred
- None of them could actually stop the train from moving, and it now is moving as a ghost train, with people now thinking the Midnight Express was a myth
- ***There's still one unused and unwritten golden ticket on the ticket registry, and The Conductor will keep the train going until that last ticket has been used***

### Train Cleanliness
- Although the train hasn't had a human passenger in years, the train still keeps moving as if there were still passengers
- This is why the train still looks clean and uptight despite not having passengers for years

### Mina's Ticket
- She has a train ticket that goes to a very specific location, but she isn't sure why 
- 

### Hostility Towards Mina
- 

### The Engineer's Help
